This work contains the following contents:\r\n\r\n* **sierpinski.js** : containing functions to create Sierpinski triangles (2D) and tetrahedra (3D)\r\n* **fractalBox.js** : containing functions to create fractal boxes (in 2D and 3D)\r\n* **sierpinski-examples.js** : containing example codes for sierpinski.js\r\n* **fractalBox-examples.js** : containing example codes for fractalBox.js\r\n\r\n### Sierpinski triangles and tetrahedra:\r\nOne of the most famous and simple fractals is the Sierpinski triangle (or Sierpinski Gerla), named after the mathematician who first studied its properties. There are several ways to accomplish this fractal.\r\nIn this work was applied the cluster method.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Method:\r\nThe Sierpinski triangle is a fractal cluster, that is obtained from a two-dimensional figure and removing certain portions. Specifically, it starts from an equilateral triangle (called axiom), and a further figure said generator:\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the first step, the original triangle is divided into four triangles of smaller size, among which the central element is removed (the one whose sides are segments jointing the midpoints of the sides of the previous triangle). The procedure is then iteratively repeated over each triangle, until you get the final result.\r\n\r\nIn this project, was created a 3D version of the Gerla, a Sierpinski tetrahedron:\r\nThe Sierpinski pyramid is the 3D version of a fractal cluster, and follows the same rules of the triangle, with the difference that the \"basic block\" is formed by a triangular-based pyramid instead of a triangle. At each iteration, the pyramids are replaced by a suitably scaled version of the generator.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
